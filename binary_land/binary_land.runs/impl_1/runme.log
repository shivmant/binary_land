WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net my_background/rgb_out_nxt_reg[10]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_background/rgb_out_nxt_reg[10]/L3_2/O, cell my_background/rgb_out_nxt_reg[10]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
